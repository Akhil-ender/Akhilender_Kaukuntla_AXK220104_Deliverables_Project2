# This is a Loan Approval System 

## About the Dataset

The dataset is from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market (SBA Overview and History, US Small Business Administration (2015)). 
Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment.
There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.

This dataset has multiple variables that help us decide what are the chancees that an indivdual can deafualt on a loan and then based on this the loan shall be approved or not.
